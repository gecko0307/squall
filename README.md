Squall
======
Audio engine for games. Originally written by Marat Gilyazetdinov (Squall 1.48 was open-sourced in 2009). I plan to modernize the code base and port the engine to Linux, add OSS or ALSA support. So far I haven't modified anything, just transcoded all the files into UTF-8.

Features

* Supports VAW, MP3, WMA, OGG/Vorbis and a variety of tracker formats including MOD, S3M, XM, IT and many others
* Output via DirectSound
* 3D sound support
* Hardware acceleration support
